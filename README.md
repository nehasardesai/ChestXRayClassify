# Classify Chest X-Ray Images to determine Pneumonia  
This repository uses a public dataset to classify chest x-ray images to determine if the patient has pneumonia. It is a good example to dip your feet into the world of deep learning with MATLAB.

We use a [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2) of validated Optical Coherence Tomography and chest X-ray images described and analyzed in "Deep learning-based classification and referral of treatable human diseases" [1]. The OCT Images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. OCT Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
This dataset is available on Mendeley by Elsevier.
